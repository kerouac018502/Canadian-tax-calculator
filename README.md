**How To Use**

The Wealthsimple 2021 Free Income Tax Calculator supports the following web page input fields that are mapped to a corresponding LibreOffice Calc named range:
* input field employmentIncome -> LibreOffice Calc named range IN_employmentIncome
* selfEmploymentIncome -> IN_selfEmploymentIncome
* rrspDeduction -> N_rrspDeduction
* "capitalGains" -> IN_capitalGains
* eligibleDividends -> IN_eligibleDividends
* ineligibleDividends -> IN_ineligibleDividends
* otherIncome -> IN_otherIncome
* incomeTaxesPaid -> IN_incomeTaxesPaid

If the named input range does not exist in the Model spreadsheet file then a value of 0 is supplied to the Wealthsimple 2021 Free Income Tax Calculator for that field.

The Wealthsimple 2021 Free Income Tax Calculator supports the following web page output fields that are mapped to a corresponding LibreOffice Calc named range:
* totalIncome -> OUT_totalIncome
* totalTax -> OUT_totalTax
* afterTaxIncome -> OUT_afterTaxIncome
* averageTaxRate -> OUT_averageTaxRate
* marginalTaxRate -> OUT_marginalTaxRate

If the named output range does not exist in the Model spreadsheet file then the Wealthsimple 2021 Free Income Tax Calculator result is ignored for that field.

**User Notes**

LibreOffice must be installed to make use of the included Sample.ods spreadsheet file. Python and Basic macros are pre-installed into the spreadsheet by default so no additional programming is required to make the spreadsheet work. The file is a standard ODS archive generated by LibreOffice and can be fully customized using LibreOffice spreadsheet functions without additional software development. The Sample spreadsheet is a really good starting point to make a customized portfolio tracking spreadsheet.
