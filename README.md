**User Notes**

LibreOffice must be installed to make use of the included Sample.ods spreadsheet file. Python and Basic macros are pre-installed into the spreadsheet by default so no additional programming is required to make the spreadsheet work. The file is a standard ODS archive generated by LibreOffice and can be fully customized using LibreOffice spreadsheet functions without additional software development. The Sample spreadsheet is a really good starting point to make a customized portfolio tracking spreadsheet.
